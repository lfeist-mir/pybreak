# Pybreak v0.1
Basically Breakout but coded with python library Pygame and a retro feel

All graphic and musical assets have been crafted wy hand with love. You're free to use them in your project if you give me credit one way or another.

## How to play
While in the folder, type in a terminal
> pip install pygame
> python main.py

## Known bugs
* Some corner collisions make the ball goes through the brick
* At high speed, collisions are badly calculated so the ball goes through the paddle.
